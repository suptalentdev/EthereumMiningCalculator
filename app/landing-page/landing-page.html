    <h1>Cryptocurrency Mining Calculator</h1>
    <p>A free browser-based tool providing predictive block-solving statistics and cost projection for cryptocurrency mining.</p>
    <p>Math & logic written by a quantum astrophysicist. Seriously.
      <br><span style="font-size: .8em;">UI by some dude with a Mac and a Bootstrap release.<span>

    <h1>Seems cool?</h1>
    <p>We've got two things going on here, a tool allowing you to forecast miner
      performance based on custom variables and another allowing you to check the performance of your current 
      miner by providing an Ethereum address.</p>
      <p>At this stage we're mainly focused on Ethereum, however you'll find you can apply
      aspects of the forecasting tool to most cryptocurrencies. This project is still under active development, there will be bugs.

    <h2>Statistical Forecasting</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Provides block-solving and cost forecasting and statistics for a miner given a set of input variables
      (eg, hashrate, difficulty, power costs etc).</p>
    <p>Provides optional difficulty prediction using real-time blockchain statistics and cool
      math.</p>

    <h2>Miner Performance Analysis</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Enter your miners Ethereum address and see how it is performing compared to its statistical
      expectation.</p>
    <p>This is very useful for detecting issues in your miner that are directly affecting your profits.</p>

    <h1>FYI</h1>
    <p>We used Chrome to develop this. You can probably use another browser but testing for cross-compatibility is boring and we didn't do it. If you're running an up-to-date browser (that isn't IE) and you have an issue, raise it on
      our <a href="https://github.com/AgeManning/EthereumMiningCalculator">GitHub.</a>
    </p>
    <p>We don't collect any data, we promise. You can even check our <a href="https://github.com/AgeManning/EthereumMiningCalculator">open-source code.</a></p>
    <p>We use some external, public APIs to provide us with data. We cannot assure the security or accuracy of these services.</p>
