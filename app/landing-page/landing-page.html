    <p>This gives estimations of potential profits and loss for cryptocurrency mining.</p>
    <p>It provides various advanced statistics for miners given a input variables (eg, hashrate, difficulty, power costs etc).</p>
    <p>Capable of difficulty prediction using real-time blockchain statistics using some cool math.</p>

    <h2>Miner Performance Analysis</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Enter your miners Ethereum address and see how it is performing compared to its statistical
      expectation.</p>
    <p>This is very useful for detecting issues with your miner as it gives a clear statistical measure (standard deviation) to determine its operational performance.</p>
    <p>This is designed for solo-mining addresses only. Pool miners have no use for this feature.

    <h1>FYI</h1>
    <p>At this stage we're mainly focused on Ethereum, however you'll find you can apply
    aspects of the forecasting tool to most cryptocurrencies. This project is still under active development, there will be bugs.
    <p>We used Chrome to develop this. You can probably use another browser but testing for cross-compatibility is boring and we didn't do it. If you're running an up-to-date browser (that isn't IE) and you have an issue, raise it on
      our <a href="https://github.com/AgeManning/EthereumMiningCalculator">GitHub.</a>
    </p>
    <p>We don't collect any data, we promise. You can even check our <a href="https://github.com/AgeManning/EthereumMiningCalculator">open-source code.</a></p>
    <p>We use some external, public APIs to provide us with data. We cannot assure the security or accuracy of these services.</p>
