 * Turns out we need to be a little bit more fancy with our Statistics. 
 *
 * Notes: With predictive modelling we need to use the Poisson Binomial Distribution
 *      Now, we are typically dealing with a large number of trials, and although theoretically
 *      we should be calculating sums for Expectation Values and Variances (as its discrete) to save 
 *      computation time without losing really much accuracy I'll be taking the integrals of the prediction
 *      functions. 
 *     
 *      Turns out some of the integrals are complex and JS isn't fun working with complex and arctan functions. So have resorted to simple sums in some cases.
